_Always Get Better_ is a technical blog for the well-rounded programmer.Â  My goal with this site is to help other programmers become better and more knowledgeable at what they do, while at the same time becoming more skilled myself.

I welcome all comments and criticisms and hope that you find something of value within these pages.

Happy reading!

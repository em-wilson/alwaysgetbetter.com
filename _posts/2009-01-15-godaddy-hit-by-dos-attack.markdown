Until recently, Always Get Better was hosted by GoDaddy. We moved in November so I could have better control of the various web sites I am running. I can say that I was not unhappy with the service offered by GoDaddy - I just outgrew it.

I guess I got lucky this time. According to cnet, [GoDaddy was struck by a denial-of-service attack](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/godaddy-com-outage-takes-sites-offline/) on the morning of January 14, 2009. There are conflicting reports (naturally) of the exact number of sites affected ranging from several to several thousand.

Google has taken another step toward world domination with the launch of an experimental new programming languages aptly named "Go". _Go_ promises to pick up where C and Python left off, providing programmers with a new garbage-collecting low level languages suited to efficient server programming.

I spent the better part of last night looking for a way to get _Go_'s tool chain to run under Windows using Cygwin. Unfortunately the tools can't be created; even if they could, they would produce binary files which would be unusable within Cygwin/Windows due to their low-level nature.

If you are a Windows programmer hoping to give _Go_ a try, your best bet is to download the [andLinux distribution](http://www.andlinux.org/) - this is a native Linux distribution that runs similar to a virtual machine under Windows. Once you have set it up, go to the [Installing Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html) page for instructions on getting started with the new language.

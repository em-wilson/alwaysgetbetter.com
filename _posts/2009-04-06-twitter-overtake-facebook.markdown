I started writing this entry before Facebook switched to its new look. At the time there were a lot of people praising Twitter and predicting that it would soon replace Facebook as the network of choice for connecting the Internet's middle class together; that coveted position on the totem pole between the MySpace Ghetto and LinkedIn (the professional's pick).

## Why Facebook Rocked


I've been a Facebook user for about three years so I've now lived through two major design changes. The first changed the layout from a bumbling mishmash of functionality into a surgical-sterile work-flow that made the side understandable and useful (to me). Facebook's strength was the separation between users - everyone had their own "space" but fit together uniformly and professionally. It was a nice, grown-up place to be online.



## What Happened?


Now Facebook looks rather generic. The focus is fully on users' <del>tweets</del> status updates and I can't tell where my profile ends and my friends' begin. The layout still looks soothing and professional, but the service isn't as useful to me anymore. The "Facebook" distinction is gone - I'd rather mashup my own Flickr and Twitter feeds instead of have Facebook duplicate the same functionality and sell my data to every bidder.



## Will Twitter Conquer?


If you told me two months ago that Twitter would overtake Facebook, I would have laughed at you. Now Facebook has lowered its ambitions to the one-trick pony of social media / friend feed updates.

The two services weren't in the same leauge before - Facebook was a massive profile site that I could use to connect to my real-world contacts while Twitter was and is essentially a public IM service. Now the two are basically identical in my circle.

I don't mean to be a Facebook-hater. I still log in and give it a good effort; I just don't connect to it anymore. Maybe the next update will bring the site more in-line with my usage and I can enjoy the service again.

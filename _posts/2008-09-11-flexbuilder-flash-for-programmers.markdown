Since I'm not a designer (an obvious conclusion anyone will reach after taking one look at the design of _this_ site), I've never had much use for the Flash development environment, nor any real desire to learn it.

Adobe FlexBuilder 3 provides an integrated development environment (Eclipse, actually) that allows programmers to build Flash applications.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover this software, and found its brand of MXML to be very familiar coming from an ASP.NET background.

Stay tuned for updates as I learn more about this software.  Have you had any experience with it?  I welcome comments and suggestions - what should we watch for when working with this software?

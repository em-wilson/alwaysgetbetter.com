From a branding perspective, social media is about joining the conversation rather than trying to constantly send out broadcasts. Any idea worth discussing is already being talked about - if you ignore social media you aren't just failing to _get your message out_ into the wild; you are, in fact, allowing your voice to be absent from the existing discussion. There is a seismic shift occurring in the way brands and their respective owners are thinking about engaging their target audience. It isn't good enough to just get the message out anymore - more attention is being placed into measuring the effectiveness of that message.

This isn't a new idea; in fact, people have been talking about brands for as long as brands have existed. It's well known that behind every customer who speaks up about their disappointment or service problem are ten others who simply switched to a different supplier. Figuring out what people are saying "on the street" and reacting to improve based on customer expectations isn't a new concept; Facebook, Twitter and the blogosphere are only tools that make this much easier - they did not invent the conversation. So what's the big deal?

The difference we are seeing today is the easy access to information that was not present before. Employees at all levels of the organization have access to the same outside data, the same instant feedback to everything being done. Ofttimes the worker at the lowest level has _more_ sense of customer feelings than does the decision-making upper management - this has always been true, of course, so why the sudden magnification?

I believe we are seeing a generational change in business and mindset that is putting people ahead of function. Call it Generation X ([over-workers to a fault](/blog/2011/04/06/overwork-creative-work-ethic/)) passing the torch over to Generation Y (family-focused individuals). In the next several years we are going to see a greater focus toward grassroots-based marketing efforts and a continuation of the trend toward niche-based services alongside  the dismantling of mainstream distribution channels.

How to control this? Don't. Service the customer and listen to their feedback. The same ingredients that have always made businesses successful are still in place: the difference is it is now easier than ever to hear the feedback faster.

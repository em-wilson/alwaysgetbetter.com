As confident as we may be that we’re the only ones using our computers, the truth is we can’t ever be completely safe.  For my own part, I was smug in the knowledge that because I ran an up-to-date antivirus program, didn’t hang around the web’s so-called “red light districts”, and didn’t download software I was unsure of, I had nothing to fear from those nasty virus things.

Wrong.


## Just Being Careful Won’t Protect Your Computer From Attack


When NIMDA hit, I really felt violated.  Even though I did nothing to cause my computer’s fall from glory, there it was.  Where once I had the illusion of control over my space, all of a sudden it was shattered.  It’s a brave new world.

Unless giving up the Internet is an acceptable alternative, we have to live with the risk of having our computers compromised at any moment.  Apparently there are legions of “zombie networks” just waiting to be activated and used for evil – computers with hidden software controlled by enterprising criminals interested in nothing but a quick dollar.

Maybe it’s because I’m naive.  Maybe it’s because I get paid by the hour so long virus-cleansing sessions don’t cut into my dinner plate.  But I have to ask – how much of a problem is this?  If my regular actions aren’t putting me at (extra) risk, what benefit will worrying bring?


## Never Visit a Trojan Page Again


Fortunately Google exists to protect us from evil-doers by scanning the web for so-called “badware”.  When performing Google searches and attempting to access one of these “bad” sites, Google presents us with a warning and gives us the option to bail or continue with the site.

Thank goodness for that!  Let’s all uninstall our antivirus software now.

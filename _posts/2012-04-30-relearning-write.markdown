In just two weeks, Node: Up and Running will be released by O'Reilly Media. Writing a book has been a lot of hard work but also a terrific learning experience that I would love to repeat.

The biggest takeaway for me was how often I make stupid mistakes in my writing. As a developer and manager, I rely on my speaking and writing abilities every day - so I take my ability to express myself for granted because I have to do it every day.

When a professional editor takes a piece of writing, they aren't looking at it in the same way a co-worker would. A co-worker knows me, understands some of the subtleties of the context I'm writing about, and can subconsciously apply meaning to ambiguities in the text or conversation. A casual reader doesn't have the same context, and the copy editor is able to filter that out and make adjustments to the text that leave my meaning intact but change the delivery.

In other words, the text that came out of the editing process makes me look really smart (I wish!). I've learned the secret to clear communication is in keeping the message brief. Especially in a technical book, the audience can't be expected to deconstruct prose - it's up to the writer to make their point and get out of the way.

I've also learned that I use the same turns of phrases over and over again. Reading 50 pages of my own writing in a row with the same sentence transitions is boring as heck, and I'm able to see this strikingly clear when it's annotated by a totally impartial writer.

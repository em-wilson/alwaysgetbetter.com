The mobile web is finally starting to be taken seriously. Trying to access the Internet on a 2" screen is torturous at best; only rare gems like GMail actually bother to display content optimized for hand-held devices. Forget trying to access JavaScript - or worse, Flash - menus. Any image wider than 100 pixels causes the text-wrapping to fail forcing the user to scroll vertical _and horizontally_.

Early in December 2008, [the W3C announced a new MobileOK Checker](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/w3c_mobileok_checks_mobile_fri.php) addition to their excellent suite of quality assurance tools that include the famous CSS and HTML validators.

The MobileOK checker reviews the markup and overall page content against a set of basic tests created for mobile platforms. Always Get Better scores 81% - not bad considering the site is essentially an out-of-the-box Wordpress with no particular optimizations in place.

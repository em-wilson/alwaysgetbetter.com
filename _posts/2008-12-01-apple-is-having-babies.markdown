We rented Baby Mama this weekend.  I was happily surprised to find [PC Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hodgman) in the role of the fertility doctor - perhaps a nod to [Mac Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Long)'s film appearances.  It warms my heart to see those references transitioning into the cultural lexicon.  All this got me thinking about Apple's "Get a Mac" campaign; there have been some funny ads circulating around the net lately, including some Flash videos seemingly spreading between ad spots (how _do_ they do that?).

The newest byte is that due to a shortage of trained developers, talented [programmers can earn $125-$200 per hour by developing iPhone applications](http://blogs.oreilly.com/iphone/2008/11/turning-ideas-into-application.html).  Unbelievable!  Where is my old iBook when I need it - buried under a stack of music CDs with an old version of OS X that doesn't support the iPhone SDK.  Maybe the time is right to spring for a new laptop if there is a potential to earn $250,000 by creating a decent marketable application.  Gold rushes like this don't act long - talk about striking when the iron is hot!

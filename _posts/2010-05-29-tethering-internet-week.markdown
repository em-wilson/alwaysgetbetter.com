So I've been tethering my phone and using it as a backup Internet connection for just over a week now and so far I have been pretty happy with the results.

Using Xplornet as my primary source and my cell phone tethered into my computer via USB, I'm actually able to get fairly reliable service - the computer switches back and forth between whichever connection happens to have access to the Internet.

This could work...

I see that Bell is now offering a 2Mbps modem for rural residents. I'd like to try that as an alternative to Xplornet - maybe I'll be able to drop my contract in March and have reliable net.

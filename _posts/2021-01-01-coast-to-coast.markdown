  description: Zipping across the continent
---




I didn't want to end the year without posting at least once.







In case anyone wants to know what I've been up to, last year I left my CTO role at a startup in Vancouver, changed my base of operation to Nova Scotia and joined an non-profit.  I'm working with a fantastic group of people and couldn't be happier right now.







My public output has been pretty low for the last year or so. Looking back, I think I needed to get out of the fast lane for a bit. The last decade I moved across the continent twice, immersed in startup culture, published two books, homeschooled three kids, and generally had an iron in the fire constantly. The pace of life is much slower here and I've enjoyed taking some time to regroup, enjoy the kids, and heal.







Some big stuff is in the works. I'm looking forward to announce some new projects I am excited to share with the world.







Here's to a fantastic 2021!

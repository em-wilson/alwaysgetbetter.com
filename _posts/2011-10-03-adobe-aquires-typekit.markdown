Today Adobe announced its acquisition of Typekit, a web font hosting service that allows designers to use any typeface with their sites rather than relying on standard "safe" font families.

This is an interesting development. Adobe's Flash player already supports proprietary fonts, which suggests that the company is looking at alternate technologies for its future development. Obviously Flash will remain relevant for more time to come, but as competitors increasingly jump onto the HTML5 bandwagon, Adobe is wise to increase its arsenal of standards-compliant technology.

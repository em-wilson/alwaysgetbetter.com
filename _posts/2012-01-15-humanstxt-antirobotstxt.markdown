If you don't want a search engine to read some or all of the files on your site, you can create a _robots.txt_ file. (Looking through the blog archive, I realize I've never gone through the construction and contents of that important file, so this is a promise to one day return and fix that!)

When you want the opposite - accessible pages and author credit, create a _humans.txt_ file. Although not an "official" standard, it is a fun way to acknowledge the (sometimes many) hardworking individuals behind the creation of a web site.

An example is:

    
    
    /* TEAM */
    Leader: Em Wilson
    Site: http://www.alwaysgetbetter.com
    Twitter: HawkWilson
    Location: Ottawa, ON
    
    /* THANKS */
    Seth Godin: http://www.sethgodin.com
    Steve Pavlina: http://www.stevepavlina.com
    Phil Haack: http://haacked.com
    
    /* SITE */
    Last Update: Jan 14, 2012
    Standards: HTML5, CSS3
    Software: Wordpress
    



In most cases, you would want to include at least a TEAM and SITE section. Clearly the exact fields are left to your imagination, but it's a very simple way to acknowledge the people who helps (directly or in spirit) a site to get to fruition.

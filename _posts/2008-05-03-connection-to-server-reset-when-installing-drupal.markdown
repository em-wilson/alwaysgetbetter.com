Has anyone else had this issue?

When I try to install Drupal on a Windows 2003 Apache server, I get a pause and then "Connection Reset" error under Firefox.  If I then try to install it using Internet Explorer, the installation process comes up immediately and works without a hitch.

I still can't seem to get the admin 'Modules' page to load at all - PHP is crashing.  That is an entirely separate issue as far as I can tell.

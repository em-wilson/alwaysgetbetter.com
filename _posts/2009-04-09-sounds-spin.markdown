You have to shake your head every time someone goes off about "netbooks", those wonderful, tiny, _cute_ computers that don't cost very much. When you look at them, what do you really see? How about a crappy laptop that can barely run Windows. [The thing is cheap](http://gigaom.com/2009/01/26/netbook-cheap-pc/) in more ways than one - but somehow marketers have been able to spin that as a good thing and make big profits off useless hardware without needing to develop anything new.



## This Brave New World Seems Just Like the Old


Anything sounds better with a little bit of spin - Web 1.0 is clunky, slow, ugly. Web 2.0 is a designer's dream, sexy, with new technology. Well, no. The technology isn't new at all - the web is the same. The only difference is enough marketers held onto the "Web 2.0" buzz phrase and shouted it repeatedly long enough that it became accepted as fact.



## What's So Social About Media?


There was never anything truly "new" about New Media. There's nothing earth shattering about Social Media either. Call it a new paradigm all you want, there is nothing different between it and "old" media: the goal is to communicate our message to as many people as possible. How others perceive your brand and how you react to that feedback is not something new and alien - it's just a lot faster now than it used to be. Your audience is your focus group. Traditional roles haven't changed one bit - their owners have.

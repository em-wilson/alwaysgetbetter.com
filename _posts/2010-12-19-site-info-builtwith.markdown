There are better tools that give more information than this one, but I wanted to point out the reports [generated by BuiltWith](http://builtwith.com/alwaysgetbetter.com).

BuiltWith scans your site and displays a nice description of site components it finds - useful for non-tech users who need to gain a quick understanding of the architecture used by a competitor or interesting site.

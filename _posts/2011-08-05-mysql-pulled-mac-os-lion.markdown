Apple-based LAMP developers be warned: the new version of OS X does not include MySQL, which was formerly part of the developer tools shipped with the operating system. In its place look for deliciously Oracle-free PostgreSQL. Of course, developers can and will continue to download MySQL and install it themselves, but the out-of-box experience moving forward will be with PostgreSQL.

Although it is still an extremely popular database, Oracle's presence in the MySQL world has put a chill over business users considering using the product as the backbone of their data solutions. [Other databases with similar purposes exists](/blog/2011/03/24/drizzle-mysql-cloud/) but none have the deep community boasted by PostgreSQL.

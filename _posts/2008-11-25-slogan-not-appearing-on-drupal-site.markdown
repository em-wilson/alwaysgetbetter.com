A common issue faced by theme developers is that of the site slogan not appearing even when the variable **$site_slogan** is present.

The site slogan is disabled by default.  To turn it on in Drupal 6.6 go to the Theme selection list and choose _Configuration_.  The site slogan is one of the checkboxes available on the left-hand side.

The same thing might have to be done in the theme-specific settings to take effect.

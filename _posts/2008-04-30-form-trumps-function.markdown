One (sad?) truth I have learned through the past several years is this: Form Trumps Function, every time.  You can write the most elegant code in the world, produce an application that meets requirements 100%, but if it isn't _pretty to look at_, your time has been wasted.

In fact - you can show a client a beautiful shell of an application that has no functionality at all, and they will love it.  Show them the same application feature-complete but without the design, and they will not want to pay for it.

The bottom line is this - when writing code, be it for web or for the desktop, always have an eye for the 'look' of your product.  Even when a separate designer is involved, the programmer can take responsibility for the 'feel' of the application - how the buttons move around, tab order, this kind of thing.

I am considering spinning this blog off to a second one devoted to designing applications (both GUI and web).  The design element can't be ignored, so hopefully getting programmers more involved in the process will improve the situation on all levels.

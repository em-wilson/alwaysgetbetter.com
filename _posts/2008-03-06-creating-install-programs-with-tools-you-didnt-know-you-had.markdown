I never knew about this little program until I found [Alfred's Tech Blog](http://alfred.co.in/tips-tricks/four-programs-you-didnt-know-existed-on-your-computer/).  If you want to quickly make install files and are running Windows, just go to Start->Run... and type **iexpress.**

If I had known about this years ago I could have saved a lot of script-writing in other utilities.  Microsoft even provides [documentation](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/ie/ieak/techinfo/deploy/60/en/iexpress.mspx?mfr=true)!

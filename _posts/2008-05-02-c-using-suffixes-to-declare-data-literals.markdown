This isn't new, but handy to have.Â  In order to tell the compiler which data type we're using, we use suffix notation as follows:



	
  * Unsigned integer, U: e.g. 34506U

	
  * Long integer (signed), L: e.g. 5297532L

	
  * Unsigned long integer, UL: e.g. 30958UL

	
  * Float, F: e.g. 13.6F

	
  * Double, D: e.g. 14.3D

	
  * Decimal, M: e.g. 19.95M

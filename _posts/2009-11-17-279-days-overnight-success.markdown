Chris Guillebeau offers his e-book _279 Days to Overnight Success_ for free on his blog. This is a great piece of writing that debunks the popular myths about "making it" blogging.




  
  1. Don't rely on Google/Adsense as a "get-rich-quick" vehicle - they aren't

  
  2. You don't need millions of visitors and command of Digg to do well

  
  3. You _will_ have to work hard

  
  4. Overnight success means 'months or years', not 'days'

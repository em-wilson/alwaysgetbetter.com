I recently transferred AlwaysGetBetter.com from GoDaddy to MediaTemple.  Although their administrative interface was somewhat, I found GoDaddy's hosting service decent enough to meet my needs so the move has nothing to do with dissatisfaction in their service.

MediaTemple was recommended to me by a close programmer friend who has been using their service for some time and had nothing but glowing reviews for them.  So far the hosting seems alright - the setup was almost instantaneous and the administrative tools very easy to work with.  Their pricing is a little on the high side but certainly not unreasonable.
